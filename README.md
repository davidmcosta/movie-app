I'm excited to introduce my latest project: Movie App â€” a comprehensive platform to discover, search, and explore films.

Built from the ground up using React and Vite, this application leverages the robust TMDB API to provide real-time movie data.

Key Features:

Intelligent Search with useDebounce: Minimizes unnecessary API calls, enhancing performance and user experience.

Modern Design with Tailwind CSS 4.0: Offers a responsive and visually appealing interface.

Efficient API Integration: Demonstrates advanced techniques for seamless data handling.

Backend Management with Appwrite: Ensures smooth ranking and search functionalities.

Fully Deployed: The app is live and ready for exploration.

Feel free to star the repository if you find it valuable.
